# String-Reversal-and-Palindrome-checker
This project involves developing an assembly language program using EMU8086 that reverses a given string and checks if it is a palindrome. The program begins by initializing the data segment and setting pointers to the original and reversed strings. It first calculates the length of the input string (which ends with a $ symbol) and then reverses the string by copying characters from the end of the original string to the beginning of a new string. After appending the $ terminator to the reversed string, the program displays the reversed version using a DOS interrupt. It then compares the original and reversed strings character by character to determine whether they are identical. If they match entirely, it concludes that the string is a palindrome and displays an appropriate message. If any character differs, it indicates that the string is not a palindrome. The program effectively demonstrates low-level string manipulation, looping, and conditional logic in assembly, while also utilizing DOS interrupts for input/output operations.
